/**
 * Resolving a wizard step's topic to the rulebook's own page.
 *
 * The two editions are shaped completely differently, and that asymmetry is the whole point of the
 * module — so it is what these tests pin down:
 *
 *  - **2024** puts all of character creation in one entry with the *stable* id `phbCreatingAChar`,
 *    so it resolves by id, and it exists in two packs (the PHB module's fuller copy and the
 *    system's free-rules one) with a real preference between them.
 *  - **2014** spreads the same ground across chapter entries whose ids are **random**, verified
 *    against the installed system content — so those must resolve by entry *name*, and a test that
 *    let them resolve by id would pass here and fail in a real world.
 *
 * The packs are faked at the `game.packs` seam because that is exactly the boundary the module
 * treats as untrusted: it must return null, never throw, for a world missing the book entirely.
