 *
 * Why this exists: the README's pictures are the module's shop window, and they go stale the
 * moment the UI is restyled. Taking fourteen of them by hand means fourteen chances to catch a
 * different character, a different window size, or a half-loaded portrait. Here the character is
 * seeded and identical every run, so a single screenshot can be retaken on its own and still
 * match the rest of the set.
 *
 * Output goes straight to `docs/screenshots/`, overwriting in place — review the diff in git
 * before keeping it.
