 * The build under test: a character produced by the Simple Character Creator's own pipeline.

 * The wizard's UI exists only to fill a {@link CreatorState}; the actual build is
 * `assembleActor(state, source, equipment)`, which resolves the choices, stages the origin items
 * on an AdvancementManager, and drives them through the shared `LevelUpDriver`. This adapter
 * populates that state directly from the scenario and calls the real assembler — so the whole
 * choice-resolver → creation-manager → driver → commit path is exercised, without the harness
 * having to click through wizard steps whose bugs are not what this comparison is about.
 *
 * The scenario answers the *same* table the native adapter uses: advancement id → picks. Mapping
 * that onto the creator's storage (`state.advChoices[source][selKey]`) is this file's real job,
 * because the resolver splits one advancement into several requirements when it carries several
 * choice groups (a Trait with two pools), each with its own `selKey`.

 * Wait for the writes the system makes *off* a commit to land, before anything reads the actor.
 *
 * Several of dnd5e's `_onCreate` handlers finish the job with a deliberately un-awaited
 * `actor.update`: `SubclassData` sets `attributes.spellcasting` for a subclass-derived caster,
 * `ClassData` assigns the primary class, `BackgroundData` links the background. All of them arrive a
 * tick or more after `commit()` resolves, so reading the actor immediately compares a settled build
 * against an unsettled one — which reads as a missing casting ability or an unlinked background.
 *
 * Watching the actor go quiet is not enough on its own: "unchanged since the last sample" is true
 * *trivially* in the window before a pending write has landed, so a naive version returns
 * immediately and reads the actor a moment too early. Hence `floor` — the earliest this may conclude
 * — with the quiet check on top of it to catch the slower cases.
 *
 * The floor is per-caller because the right one differs by an order of magnitude. A level-up commits
 * one or two items and is done almost at once; Ember's hand-off creates the whole character in a
 * single write and chains `ClassData`, `BackgroundData` and race handlers behind it. A floor long
 * enough for the second would add tens of seconds per scenario to the first, and the incremental
 * sweep pays it twenty times over.

 * Carry a just-created level-1 character up to the scenario's target level.

 * driven by `LevelUpDriver` and committed once — with the interactive `LevelUpShell` replaced by a
 * {@link ScenarioChoiceProvider}. The shell exists only to fill the provider interface that
 * `autoResolve` reads, so answering it directly still exercises the entire driver: the walk, the
 * subclass resolution, the feature synthesis a subclass pulls in, and the commit.
 *
 * `_sogromLevelUp` is set for the same reason the native side sets it: the manager is never
 * rendered here, and the flag stops the module's own takeover hook claiming it if anything else
 * forces a render.
 * @param {Actor5e} actor
 * @param {object} scenario
 * @param {Set<string>} consumed   Shared with the creation pass; the provider records into it so
 *   the orphaned-answer check can see answers read by either leg.
