/**
 * Canonicalise an actor so two independently-built characters can be compared.
 *
 * The two build paths create the same *content* with different random ids, so a raw
 * `toObject()` diff is 100% noise. Normalising does three things:
 *
 *  1. **Identity, not id.** Every embedded item is keyed by what it *is* — its compendium
 *     source uuid — rather than by its random `_id`. Duplicates of the same source are
 *     disambiguated by an occurrence index after a stable sort.
 *  2. **Reference rewriting.** Item ids leak into advancement bookkeeping (`value.added` is
 *     *keyed* by item id; `value.feat`, `value.replaced`, `system.details.originalClass` and
 *     `flags.dnd5e.advancementOrigin` all embed them). Every 16-character id found anywhere —
 *     in a value, inside a compound string, or as an object key — is rewritten to its identity.
 *  3. **Dropping the incomparable.** Timestamps, sort orders, ownership, and the identity/
 *     biography fields the creator writes but a bare native build never touches.
 *
 * What survives is exactly what the advancement machinery produced. Derived state
 * (ability totals, hit points, proficiencies, scale values) is captured separately in
 * {@link derivedSnapshot}, because a source-only diff would miss a bug that changes what the
 * character can actually *do*.
