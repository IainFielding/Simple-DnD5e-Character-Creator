/**
 * The answer book: one decision-answering strategy, consumed identically by both build adapters.
 *
 * A hand-written answer table (`scenarios.mjs`) works for a handful of characters and not at all for
 * a sweep — ninety-odd subclasses carried to level 20 raise thousands of choices, and every one of
 * them has to be answered the *same way* on both sides or the diff reports answer differences
 * dressed up as character differences.
 *
 * Two guarantees make that safe:
 *
 * **Memoised.** An answer is computed once, on the first ask, and keyed by `advId@level`. Whoever
 * asks second gets the identical value — not an equivalent one, the same one. That is the whole
 * contract: the two adapters walk the build at different times, off different clones, in different
 * orders, and none of that can make them disagree about what was chosen.
 *
 * **Preferably static.** Generation reads `advancement.configuration` wherever it can, so a pick is
 * stable across runs and across the two sides independently. Where a choice genuinely depends on the
 * character (an expertise pool is "skills you are already proficient in"; an invocation's item
 * prerequisites are "features you already hold") the first asker resolves it against its own clone
 * and the memo carries that to the second. If the second side then does not offer that key, it says
 * so loudly — `distribute()` on the creator side and `untilFound()` on the native side both refuse a
 * pick that was never offered — which is a real finding, not a false failure.
 *
 * Answers come out in the shapes `scenarios.mjs` documents and the adapters already consume, so a
 * generated scenario and a hand-written one are indistinguishable downstream:
 *
 *   HitPoints                 "avg"
 *   Size                      "med"
 *   Trait                     ["skills:ath", "skills:ins"]
 *   ItemChoice                { uuids: [...], ability: "int" }
 *   ItemGrant                 "int"
 *   AbilityScoreImprovement   { int: 2, con: 1 }   — the total per ability, fixed part included
