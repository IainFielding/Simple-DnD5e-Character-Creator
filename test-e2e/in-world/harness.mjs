 * **Why this is an assertion and not a comparison.** Everything else here diffs two builds, and this

 * no native behaviour to compare against — the creator invents that step. Teaching `native.mjs` to
 * "pick class spells" would mean the harness writing its own reference and then checking we match
 * it, which tests the expectation rather than the system. The bug is a property of *one* character
 * anyway, so that is what gets checked.
 *
 * **The bug.** A class or subclass `ItemGrant` declaring `configuration.spell.prepared = 2` hands
 * out an always-prepared spell — Divine Smite at Paladin 2, a Life Domain's domain spells. Many are
 * also on the class's own list, so the player could pick the same spell again and end up with two
 * Items. Only the plain copy counts toward `preparation.value` (`SpellData#countsPrepared` requires
 * `prepared === 1`), so the duplicate permanently consumed a prepared slot for a spell the character
 * already always has, and being a plain copy it burned a real spell slot when clicked.
 *
 * **The refusal matters more than the merges.** A missed merge is a duplicate the player can delete;
 * a wrong merge silently destroys an entitlement. Magic Initiate grants a spell *and* a Cleric may
 * prepare the same spell normally — two different things the character can do — so the last case
 * asserts those stay separate. It is the assertion most likely to catch a later "simplify the merge".
 *
 * Cases are content-driven: the overlapping spell is discovered by walking the class and subclass
 * documents for always-prepared grants and intersecting with the class's own spell list, rather than
 * being written down. A hard-coded uuid goes stale the moment a module updates, and a case that can
 * no longer find an overlap reports that rather than passing on an empty test.

 * feat-spells step's business, so both builds apply nothing and agree — which is how the Savant pick
 * being silently skipped (its option list came back empty and the block counted as complete) went
 * unnoticed. This builds a Savant Wizard to level 1 through the creator, levels it with the real
 * `LevelUpShell`, and reports what the choices step actually offers at each level, then takes the
 * first `count` options and checks the spells landed.
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {string} [options.match]   Substring of the sweep scenario id to use.
 * @param {number} [options.to]      Level to climb to.
