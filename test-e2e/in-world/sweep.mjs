/**
 * The sweeps: generated scenarios that vary **one** thing across everything the world installs.
 *
 * The hand-written scenarios in `scenarios.mjs` are chosen — each one exists to exercise a specific
 * mechanism, and its answers are argued for in a comment. These are the opposite: breadth, no
 * judgement, built both ways and diffed.
 *
 * Three axes, selected with `run.mjs --sweep --axis <name>`:
 *
 * | Axis | Varies | Holds fixed |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `subclass` (default) | every subclass installed | Human/Sage origins, points at every ASI |
 * | `species` | every 2024 species | Wizard/Evoker, Sage |
 * | `background` | every 2024 background | Fighter/Champion, Human — **a feat at every ASI** |
 *
 * The second and third exist because the first holds three things still that turned out to matter:
 * Human is the one PHB'24 species with no advancement above level 0, backgrounds were never varied
 * at all, and `generateAsi` spends every improvement on ability scores so no feat is ever taken.
 *
 * Whatever an axis holds fixed is deliberately the characterised choice — the same origins the six
 * hand-written scenarios use — so a difference is about the thing being varied and not about its
 * companions.
 *
 * Answers come from the {@link AnswerBook} generator (`generate: true`), with exactly one override:
 * the subclass itself, which is the variable being swept and the one decision generation refuses to
 * make for you.
 *
 * Level 20 because the interesting content is spread across it. A subclass grants features at four
 * or five levels, the class's ability-score improvements land at 4/8/12/16/19 (plus the Fighter's
 * and Rogue's extras), spell progression runs the whole way, and a level-3 build would test the
 * first tranche and nothing else. It is a long run — see `run.mjs --sweep`, which streams results
 * so a crash costs one scenario rather than all of them.

 * written to sit together, whose disagreements are then reported as findings about the subclass. The
 * system ships the 2014 SRD origins alongside the 2014 classes, so each edition can be built with
 * its own.
 *
 * Human and Sage stay the 2024 pair the six hand-written scenarios use, so anything they contribute
 * is already characterised. The 2014 side takes SRD Human (a flat +1 to every ability, so no
