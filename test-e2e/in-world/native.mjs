/**
 * The reference build: a character produced by the dnd5e system's own AdvancementManager.
 *
 * This is the oracle the creator is measured against, so it deliberately goes the long way round.
 * `AdvancementManager` keeps its whole pipeline private (`#forward`, `#synthesizeSteps`,
 * `#complete`) and reachable only from a click on a `[data-action]` button, and its per-step
 * flows apply themselves from their *rendered form* (`advancement-manager.mjs` line 691:
 * `flow._updateObject(event, flow._getSubmitData())`). Short-circuiting that by calling
 * `advancement.apply()` ourselves would mean re-implementing the very walk we are trying to
 * verify — a bug in step ordering or mid-walk synthesis would then be invisible to the test.
 *
 * So: render the manager for real, fill each step's actual form controls, and click Next. The
 * only per-advancement knowledge here is *which control holds which answer*, one small filler
 * per advancement type. Everything else is the system's.
 *
 * The module under test intercepts `dnd5e.preAdvancementManagerRender` and suppresses the native
 * UI for any level-up it can drive. `manager._sogromLevelUp` is the module's own re-entry guard
 * (see `levelup/intercept.mjs`), and setting it up front makes the hook stand down — so the
 * reference build runs the native wizard even with the module active.
