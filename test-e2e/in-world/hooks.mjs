/**
 * The public hook and API surface, asserted against the real wizards — running *inside* the world.
 *
 * **Why this is an assertion and not a scenario.** The equivalence suite builds a character twice
 * and diffs the results, and hooks have no native counterpart to diff against: dnd5e emits nothing
 * comparable, so there is no reference side. Forcing them into that shape would make them weaker,
 * which is the same argument `checkGrantedSpells` and `checkSidekicks` make for themselves.
 *
 * **Why it cannot live in the equivalence adapter either.** `creator.mjs` calls `assembleActor()`
 * and `driver.autoResolve()` directly and never constructs a shell — deliberately, since the UI is
 * not what that comparison is about. Eleven of the thirteen hooks are emitted *from* the shells, so
 * they are structurally invisible there. This module opens the real `CreatorShell` and the real
 * `LevelUpShell`, the way `shots.mjs` does, because the emission sites are the subject.
 *
 * **What the unit tests already cover, and this does not repeat:** the name registry, the veto
 * semantics of `fireCancellableHook`, and a throwing listener not counting as a veto
 * (`test/api.test.mjs`). Those are pure logic and belong in vitest.
 *
 * **What only this can cover:** whether each hook is emitted *at the right place, in the right
 * order, exactly once*. The case that earns the whole file is `characterCreated` on a build that
 * starts above level 1: the creator hands the 1 → N climb to the level-up wizard, so the character
 * is not finished when `assembleActor` returns, and the hook has to fire from the *other* wizard —
 * once, with the level actually reached. Nothing in a unit test can see that.
 *
 * Decisions inside the level-up wizard are answered by the harness's own generating `AnswerBook`
 * rather than by clicking: what is under test is the shell's *apply*, not its screens.
