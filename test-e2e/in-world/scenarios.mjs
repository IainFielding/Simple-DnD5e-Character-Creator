/**
 * Scenarios: one decision script per character, consumed by *both* build adapters.
 *
 * A scenario names the origins and the base ability scores, then answers every choice those
 * origins raise. Answers are keyed by **advancement id** — the id in the compendium item's
 * `system.advancement` array — because that is the one identifier both adapters see: the native
 * wizard reads it off `manager.step.flow.advancement.id`, and the creator's choice resolver
 * stamps it on every requirement as `advId`.
 *
 * Answer shapes, by advancement type:
 *   HitPoints                 "avg" | "max" | <number>   (omit for a level-1 original class)
 *   Size                      "sm" | "med" | …
 *   Trait                     ["skills:ath", "skills:ins"]   — flat, across every choice pool
 *   ItemChoice                ["<uuid>", …]  or  { uuids: [...], ability: "int" }
 *   ItemGrant (spell ability) "int"
 *   AbilityScoreImprovement   { int: 2, con: 1 }   — the *total* per ability, fixed part included
 *
 * Finding the ids: `node run.mjs <world> --ids <uuid>` prints an item's advancements with their
 * ids, titles and options, which is how these tables are written and kept in step with content
 * updates.
 *
 * Every scenario here states all of its own answers. A scenario may instead set `generate: true` and
 * have the {@link AnswerBook} invent whatever its table leaves out — that is how the subclass sweep
 * (`sweep.mjs`) covers ninety-odd characters without ninety-odd tables. These six deliberately do
 * not: each exists to exercise one mechanism, its answers are argued for below, and a generated pick
 * would quietly change what is being tested. Their difference counts are recorded in the README and
 * are only comparable run to run because the answers are fixed.

   * A 2014 Ranger who takes **Tasha's alternatives** instead of the 2014 features: Favored Foe and

   *
   * Every other scenario and sweep keeps the default — the 2014 base of each pair — so the swap path
   * had only unit coverage. The two levels exercise its two routes: level 1 goes through the
   * creation Choices step (`advChoices.class[<grant id>]`, the whole keep list), level 3 through the
   * level-up driver's `setOptionalGrant`. The native side ticks the same list in Tasha's own flow.
   *
   * The answer is the whole keep list, unpaired items included (Ranger Archetype at level 3), which is
   * the shape the creator stores. None of these features carries advancements, so the swap changes
   * only which items land.
   *
   * **Canny is deliberately not in the answer, and this scenario fails on it (2026-09-19).** Tasha's
   * flow ties Canny to Deft Explorer — its `_onRender` locks Canny's checkbox to Deft Explorer's radio
   * and `_handleForm` grants or reverses it alongside — so the native build gets Canny without being
   * asked. The creator models Canny as a competing alternative (or, on this two-base grant, drops it:
   * `replacementGroups`), so its Deft Explorer arrives without Canny. That is a module bug; once
   * fixed, the creator should grant Canny from this same answer.
