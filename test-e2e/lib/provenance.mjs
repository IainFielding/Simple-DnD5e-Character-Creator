/**
 * What a results file is: the header a sweep writes into it, and what can be recovered from the
 * files written before headers existed.
 *
 * A sweep produces `sweep-results.jsonl`, which is then renamed to something like
 * `sweep-results-final-2.4.0.jsonl` and kept as a baseline for the next run to diff against. The
 * scenario records carry no run-level facts at all — not the flags, not the versions, not the day —
 * so a directory of these files is a directory of anonymous 2 MB blobs whose meaning lives only in
 * the name somebody typed. That was survivable while every run meant the same thing. It stopped
 * being survivable when `--sweep` changed its default from a single jump to one level at a time:
 * the older files became non-comparable with the newer ones, look identical, and say nothing.
 *
 * So a run now opens its file with a `_meta` line. Two rules make it worth having:
 *
 *   - It goes *inside* the jsonl, not in a sidecar. Archiving a baseline is a rename, and a rename
 *     leaves a sidecar behind — the sidecar would be lost in exactly the case it is needed for.
 *   - It carries no `id`. Every reader keys scenario records by `id`, so a header is skipped by
 *     construction, and a file without one stays as readable as it ever was.
 *
 * {@link deriveMeta} is the other half: the twenty-odd headerless baselines already on disk are not
 * a lost cause, because a run leaves fingerprints in its records. An incremental run records a
 * per-level `levels.profile`; a jump run has nothing to record until the end and leaves it empty.
 * The axis is in the id prefix, the level in the profile. Derived facts are marked as derived —
 * they are good enough to sort a directory out, not good enough to trust as provenance.
