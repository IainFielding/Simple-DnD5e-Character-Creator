/**
 * The chat cards this module posts when a character is finished and when a level-up is applied.
 *
 * Two shapes, one module, because they answer the same table-facing question — "what just happened
 * to this character?" — and share the whisper/permission plumbing below.
 *
 *   - {@link postCreationSummary} reads a *finished* actor. Everything on a new character is new,
 *     so there is nothing to diff: the card is a snapshot.
 *   - {@link captureLevelUpSummary} + {@link postLevelUpSummary} are a pair, and the split matters.
 *     A level-up's story is the difference between the driver's clone and the real actor, and that
 *     difference only exists *before* the commit — afterwards the two agree and there is nothing
 *     left to read. So the shell captures a plain-data snapshot first, commits, then posts it.
 *
 * Nothing here is allowed to break the flow that called it. A character that was built, or a level
 * that was applied, must not be undone by a chat card failing to render — so every entry point
 * swallows its own errors into the debug log and returns.
 *
 * For a junior dev: `capture…` runs BEFORE `driver.commit()`, `post…` runs AFTER. Swapping that
 * order silently produces an empty card, because a committed actor and its clone are identical.
