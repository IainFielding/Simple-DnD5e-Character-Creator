/**
 * Keeping other people's windows visible over the fullscreen takeover.
 *
 * The creator and the level-up wizard run as a fixed, viewport-filling element sitting just under
 * Foundry's tooltip layer (~9998) — high enough that an open actor sheet behind them can't peek
 * through, which is the entire point of a takeover. The cost is that *every* Foundry window is
 * behind them too, including ones the player deliberately opened from inside our own UI: click a
 * content link on the Review screen and the item sheet renders faithfully, at a z-index in the
 * low hundreds, completely hidden underneath us.
 *
 * So the window that was opened is raised above us, and we stay where we are.
 *
 * This is the second design. The first lowered the takeover instead — a `.is-yielding` class
 * dropping it to z-index 90 — on the reasoning that changing our own element is more reliable than
 * out-specifying an inline z-index that Foundry rewrites on every render of a window whose class
 * names we don't control.
 *
 * Both halves of that were wrong. Lowering ourselves below Foundry's window layer does not reveal
 * *the* window, it reveals *every* window — and the fullscreen rule's own comment names the one
 * that matters: "an open app — e.g. the actor sheet a level-up launches from — can't peek through
 * the takeover". Clicking a single item on the Review screen therefore brought up the item sheet
 * and the character sheet sitting behind it, which is not what anyone asked for.
 *
 * And we do not have to name anyone else's class names. The render hook hands us the application,
 * so we can put *our own* class on its element, and `!important` beats the inline z-index Foundry
 * rewrites on render and on focus. That is not a new trick here: the same one already lifts the
 * dnd5e Compendium Browser over the takeover from styles/creator/02-window.css, for exactly this reason.
 *
 * Raising rather than lowering also deletes the bookkeeping the old shape needed. There is no
 * reference count, because each window carries its own class; nothing has to be restored when a
 * window closes, because the class dies with the element it is on; and no `close` wrapper is
 * needed, so no exit path can strand us in the lowered state.
 *
 * Two things keep the raise honest, because the class sits on an element that is not ours and we
 * therefore cannot reliably take it off again:
 *
 *   - **Only on opening.** A window is raised on its *first* render, never on a re-render. What a
 *     re-render means is "this was already open behind us", and the level-up commit re-renders the
 *     character sheet mid-apply, which is precisely the window the takeover exists to cover.
 *   - **Only while a takeover is up.** The CSS gates on `body:has(.sogrom-creator-fullscreen)`, so
 *     the class goes inert when the wizard closes rather than leaving a sheet the player opened
 *     from the Review screen floating over everything for the rest of the session.
 *
 * One accepted limitation: raised windows all share one z-index, so clicking between two of them
 * cannot reorder them — they stack in DOM order. Two windows open over the takeover at once is
 * already the rare case, and it is a far smaller cost than burying either of them.
