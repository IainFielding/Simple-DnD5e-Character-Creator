/**
 * The creator window. Deliberately thin: it owns which step is active and what is reachable, then
 * delegates all per-step data and behaviour to the step modules. It contains no
 * class/ability/species preparation logic of its own — that lives in scripts/steps/*.
 *
 * The window chrome, the click dispatcher, Back/Next and the discard prompt are all inherited from
 * {@link CreatorShellBase}, shared with the level-up window; what's left here is the creator's own
 * step model (a fixed registry whose entries can be hidden or greyed) and the Create button.
 *
 * For a junior dev: this is a Foundry ApplicationV2 subclass — i.e. a window. The three things that
 * make it tick are the static config blocks just below plus `_prepareContext`:
 *   DEFAULT_OPTIONS – window behaviour + the "actions" map (clickable [data-action] names -> methods)
 *   PARTS           – the named Handlebars templates that make up the window's HTML
 *   _prepareContext – builds the plain-object data those templates render with
 * The mental model: state changes -> we call this.render() -> Foundry re-runs _prepareContext
 * and re-paints the PARTS. We rarely touch the DOM by hand.
