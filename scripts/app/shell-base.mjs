/**
 * The chrome and navigation both wizard windows share — the creator ({@link module:app/creator-shell})
 * and the level-up ({@link module:levelup/levelup-shell}).
 *
 * Both are the same shape of application: a rail of steps down the left, one step's stage on the
 * right, a single event dispatcher funnelling every click into the active step's `handle()`, and a
 * footer whose Back/Next walk an index through the step list. Only the *step list* differs — the
 * creator's is a fixed registry with hidden/greyed entries, the level-up's is rebuilt every render
 * as choices reveal more choices — so that part stays in each subclass and everything around it
 * lives here.
 *
 * For a junior dev: subclasses supply the step list by overriding four small members —
 * {@link CreatorShellBase#_activeStep}, {@link CreatorShellBase#_stepCount},
 * {@link CreatorShellBase#_completeFlags} and {@link CreatorShellBase#_ctx} — plus `_finish()` for
 * whatever the footer's primary button does (Create / Apply). Everything else (dispatch, Back/Next,
 * rail reachability, the discard prompt, the spell-list filter) is inherited.
 *
 * Note the `_`-prefixed members: they are *protected* by convention — inherited and overridden by
 * the two shells, but not part of any public API. Real `#private` fields can't be shared across a
 * class boundary, which is why these aren't private.

   * beside it reads "Step 9 of 10". A full bar next to a counter that is not full is a contradiction

   * on Review, which is the last step and where the old bug was.
   *
   * Completion is not lost: it is what the teal outstanding chip immediately to the right reports,
   * and what the ticks down the dossier report per step. Position and completion are genuinely
   * different questions — a player can go back and leave a finished step behind them unfinished
