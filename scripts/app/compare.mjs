/**
 * Side-by-side comparison of pinned options — the one thing Quick Build cannot do for you.
 *
 * Quick Build answers "I don't know, pick something sensible". This answers the opposite question:
 * "I know exactly what I'm choosing between, and I want them next to each other." A player weighing
 * two subclasses has to pick one, read it, pick the other, read that, and hold the first in their
 * head — the picker shows one detail page at a time, by design. So the comparison happens in
 * memory, which is where it goes wrong.
 *
 * **This module extracts almost nothing itself, and that is the whole design.** The obvious
 * implementation runs to a thousand lines, because it re-reads every advancement type per category —
 * movement, senses, resistances, scale values, damage parts — building bespoke cells for each. We
 * already do that reading once, in {@link module:data/source-index}: `advancementGroups()` flattens
 * an item's traits and its granted features and spells for the detail pane, and
 * `abilityScoreIncrease()` flattens its ASI for the origin panel. A comparison grid is a *transpose*
 * of what the detail pane already shows — so this file is a transpose, plus the handful of headline
 * fields (`system.spellcasting`, movement, senses) the pane doesn't surface because a single page
 * has room for prose instead.
 *
 * The consequence worth knowing: a row appears here because some pinned item has that trait, not
 * because we listed it. Third-party content that grants something we have never heard of gets a row
 * for it as long as dnd5e's own Trait advancement carries it, and no row when nothing has it.
 *
 * Pins are session state on the shell ({@link PinSet}), not world state: comparing is something you
 * do for thirty seconds on the way to a decision, and a pin that outlived the window would be a
 * second, invisible kind of selection.

 * {@link module:data/source-index} has already flattened for the detail pane, so those rows are a
 * transpose of work done elsewhere. A spell has no advancements at all — what a player weighs is its
 * casting time, range, duration, save and damage, which live on activities.
 *
 * dnd5e computes every one of those onto the document as `item.labels` and `activity.labels`. We
 * never read them for a *list* — two hundred index entries would have to be loaded as documents
 * first, which is exactly why {@link module:data/spell-source.buildSpellFromEntry} formats its own
 * from index fields — but a comparison holds at most {@link MAX_PINS} of them. Four documents is
