/**
 * The Ember hand-off (§ Ember): taking over the level-1 questions Ember's character builder leaves
 * to the system.
 *
 * Ember owns creation — it picks the ancestry, the culture/path background, the class, the ability
 * scores and the attunement — and then, instead of writing the character itself, it borrows the
 * system's AdvancementManager purely as a question-asking UI:
 *
 *   1. it writes name/abilities/details/token/attunement to the real actor;
 *   2. it stages the ancestry, its synthesised background, the class (at level 0) and the attunement
 *      feature onto `manager.clone` — never onto the actor;
 *   3. it pushes the class's level 0→1 steps plus the other items' level-0/1 flows, then renders;
 *   4. it waits for `dnd5e.preAdvancementManagerComplete`, takes the updates and created items from
 *      the hook, **vetoes the system's own write** and applies them itself (with `keepId`, plus its
 *      own `flags.ember.characterCreation`);
 *   5. if the manager closes without completing, it resolves to null and abandons the advancements.
 *
 * Step 3 is where `dnd5e.preAdvancementManagerRender` fires, which is our existing takeover hook
 * ({@link module:levelup/intercept}), and step 4 is exactly what {@link LevelUpDriver#commit}
 * already does at the end of an ordinary level-up. So the hand-off needs no wrapper and no patching
 * of Ember: we claim the manager, drive its clone through our own wizard, and commit — Ember's
 * listener accepts the result as if the native manager had produced it.
 *
 * What this module adds on top of the ordinary level-up:
 *   - {@link isEmberCreationManager} — recognise the hand-off (and only ever that).
 *   - {@link foldOriginScreens} — the ancestry/background decisions arrive as *level 0* flows;
 *     without this they would earn a screen labelled "Level 0" of their own.
 *   - {@link emberEquipmentStep} — starting equipment, which is not part of any advancement.
 *   - {@link stageEmberGear} — gear, currency and spell picks folded onto the clone before the
 *     commit, so Ember's single write carries them (nothing races its `actor.update`).
 *   - {@link abandonEmberCreation} — release Ember's builder when the player cancels.
 *
 * Everything here reads Ember's *internals* (it exposes no API beyond an unrelated hook), so each
 * entry point is defensive: anything that doesn't match the shape above stands down and lets Ember's
 * own flow run exactly as it does without this module.
