/**
 * The level-up window. Like the creator's shell it is deliberately thin — it owns its step list and
 * delegates per-step data and behaviour to the step modules — but it drives a {@link LevelUpDriver}
 * (the wrapped native AdvancementManager) instead of the creation state, and it commits the driver's
 * clone rather than assembling a new actor.
 *
 * The window chrome, the click dispatcher, Back/Next, rail reachability and the discard prompt all
 * come from {@link CreatorShellBase}, shared with the creator window.
 *
 * For a junior dev: this is the same ApplicationV2 pattern as creator-shell.mjs (see the big
 * teaching note there for DEFAULT_OPTIONS/PARTS/actions/_prepareContext). Two things are specific
 * to level-up:
 *   1. The step list is REBUILT every render (buildSteps), because choices reveal more choices —
 *      e.g. picking a subclass adds its feature steps. So the rail can grow between renders.
 *   2. Nothing touches the real actor until the single Apply on the review step: the level
 *      decisions live on the driver's clone, the spell picks are staged on the state, and
 *      {@link #applyLevelUp} writes both in one go before closing.

   * Apply button. Only the chrome disagreed.

   * this override the one flow in an Ember world that really is character creation would be the only
   * creation flow still wearing the pre-dossier chrome.
   *
   * Done per instance rather than by splitting the class in two because *nothing else* differs: the
   * stage, every step template and the whole dispatch path are shared already. The layout follows
   * from the parts with no CSS change at all — the creator's grid rule keys on
