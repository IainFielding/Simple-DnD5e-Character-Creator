/**
 * The Background step. Like the Class step, it pairs the origin card grid with a
 * statistics aside: a 2024 background grants an ability-score increase (typically
 * three points spread across a short list of abilities, capped at +2 each), and
 * the player allocates it here rather than later in the advancement prompt.
 *
 * The aside itself is {@link module:steps/origin-abilities-panel}, shared with the Species step —
 * under the 2014 rules the increase sits on the species instead, so both steps need the same panel
 * and neither needs it unconditionally. A background with no increase (any 2014 one) resolves to a
 * null panel context and the aside is not rendered at all.
