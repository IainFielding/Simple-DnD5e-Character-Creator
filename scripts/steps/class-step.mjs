/**
 * The Class step. Class selection and ability scores share one step: the chosen class's page and
 * the ability allocator stack down one work surface, with the class list available as a drawer
 * over it, so a player sets their scores against the class that frames them.
 *
 * The allocator used to sit in a 348px aside beside a 340px picker, which left the description
 * they were both meant to be read against about 400px on a 1400px window — see templates/steps/
 * class.hbs for the full reasoning.
 *
 * It is built by composition, not inheritance — it owns the class-list context and
 * routes ability clicks to the standalone ability panel (abilities-step.mjs). The
 * two halves stay independent; this module only stitches their context, handling,
 * and completion together.
