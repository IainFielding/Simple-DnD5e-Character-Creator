/**
 * Whether an advancement on a class item applies to *this* character's version of that class.
 *
 * A class can carry two versions of the same grant — one restricted to when it is the character's
 * original class, one to when it is not — which is how dnd5e models the reduced proficiencies a
 * multiclass entry grants (the 2024 Bard gives 3 skills and 3 tools as an original class, 1 and 1
 * as a multiclass pick). dnd5e's own `AdvancementManager` filters its step list by exactly this, so
 * an inapplicable grant never gets a step to answer and its `value` stays empty forever — which
 * means anything reading `value` directly has to apply the same filter or report that empty value
 * as an unanswered choice.
 *
 * Read here rather than off the advancement so it also works on plain `toObject()` data, which
 * carries `classRestriction` but no getters.
 *
 * **Deliberately diverges from `Advancement#appliesToClass` in one case.** `Item5e#isOriginalClass`
 * returns `null` for an item not embedded in an actor — a compendium document, which is exactly what
 * the creation grids and the choice resolver work with — and dnd5e's own getter resolves that `null`
 * as matching *both* restrictions ("always true outside an embedded class item"). Taking that
 * literally at creation would offer a Bard both its 3-skill original-class grant and its 1-skill
 * multiclass grant at once, which is the duplication this filter exists to prevent. An unanswerable
 * original-class question is therefore resolved as "yes, original" instead: the first class a
 * character takes always is one, and a real multiclass entry is embedded by the time it is asked.
