 * built and indexed once per world session and reused by every CreatorShell. A background warm
 * kicked off at `ready` (see main.mjs) means the builder opens instantly; a window opened before
 * that finishes awaits the same in-flight work behind its loading screen. The per-window
 * {@link module:state/creator-state.CreatorState} stays separate — only these read-only indexes
