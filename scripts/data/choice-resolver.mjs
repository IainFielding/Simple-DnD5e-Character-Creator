/**
 * Resolves the player-facing advancement *choices* a set of origin items presents at
 * level ≤ 1 — skill/tool/language/weapon proficiency picks (with cross-source dedupe),
 * Expertise, Size, ItemChoice (choose N features), spellcasting-ability picks — into
 * flat descriptors the Choices step renders and the assembler applies.
 *
 * Stateless by design: it reads the selected origins and the player's recorded picks
 * (`state.advChoices`) and returns fresh requirements every call, so the step and the
 * build path share one source of truth with no cache to fall stale. It prunes picks
 * that another source now grants outright, mutating `state.advChoices` in place.
 *
 * ── For a junior dev: how to read this file ──
 * A dnd5e item (a class, species, background, or a feature it grants) carries "advancements":
 * typed rules like ItemGrant (give this item), Trait (give/choose a proficiency), ItemChoice
 * (choose N features), Size, and AbilityScoreImprovement. Some are automatic; some ask the player
 * to choose. This module turns the choice-bearing ones into "requirements" — plain, UI-agnostic
 * descriptors ({ title, options, count, complete, selKey, ... }) that the Choices step renders and
 * the assembler later applies. The pipeline top to bottom:
 *   resolveChoices(state)        entry point — loops the three origins
 *     └ prepareRequirements(doc) gathers the origin + its granted features (levelOneOwners)
 *         └ parseAdvancementChoice(adv)  one advancement -> zero or more requirements (by adv.type)
 *             └ buildChoiceReq(...)      assembles one requirement + merges the player's current picks
 * "selKey" is the stable id under which a requirement's picks are stored in state.advChoices.
 * "cross-source dedupe" = if two origins offer the same skill, picking it in one greys it out in the other.

 * type alone offered all of them: a single content module contributed 300-odd class features to the
