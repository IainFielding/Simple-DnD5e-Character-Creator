/**
 * Which spell swaps a level-up may offer, by rules edition.
 *
 * "Swap" here is the one-for-one replacement a class grants *when it gains a level* — not the daily
 * re-preparation a prepared caster does on a long rest, which happens outside both of our wizards.
 * The two editions draw that line in different places:
 *
 *  - **2024.** Every Spellcasting feature says you may replace one cantrip and one spell on your
 *    list whenever you gain a level in the class. Both swaps, for anyone with something to swap.
 *  - **2014.** *No* PHB class replaces a cantrip on level-up — cantrip swapping arrived with the
 *    2024 rules (Tasha's offers it as an *optional* rule, which is a house rule, not a default).
 *    Offering it to a 2014 Sorcerer, as this step used to, grants a replacement the rules never do.
 *
 * The leveled-spell swap stays on offer for every caster, in both editions, and only its wording
 * changes. A 2014 spells-known class (Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, and the third-caster
 * subclasses) trades a spell on level-up outright. A 2014 prepared class (Cleric, Druid, Paladin,
 * Wizard, Artificer) does it after a long rest instead — but in dnd5e a prepared spell is an
 * ordinary embedded Item, so trading one for another *is* how that list changes, and withdrawing
 * the control would remove a real capability to satisfy a label. So we fix the label.
 *
 * **How many.** A class that prepares from its whole list may change *any number* of prepared
 * spells after a long rest: the Cleric and Druid in both editions, and the 2014 Paladin and
 * Artificer. Nothing in dnd5e helps a player do that, and a level-up is when players reshuffle, so
 * those classes may mark as many spells for replacement as they like (`spells: "any"`). Everyone
 * else keeps the one swap. The Wizard is the exception to both: it prepares from its *book*, so its
 * level-up has a Prepare tab instead and no swap at all ({@link module:data/spellbook}).
 *
 * @see module:levelup/steps/lvl-spells-step for the step that consumes this
