/**
 * Finding the rulebook's own page for a topic the wizard is currently asking about.
 *
 * A player mid-step often wants the actual rule, not our one-line hint — and the books already in
 * their world have it, written and laid out properly. This resolves a *topic* (not a step id, so
 * the same map serves both wizards) to a real `JournalEntryPage`, which
 * {@link module:app/source-details} then renders into the overlay the "Full Details" control
 * already uses.
 *
 * **The two editions are shaped completely differently**, which is most of what this file handles:
 *
 *  - **2024** keeps the whole of character creation in one entry with the stable id
 *    `phbCreatingAChar`, whose pages are named for the steps themselves ("Step 1: Choose a Class",
 *    "Step 3: Ability Scores"). A stable id means it resolves without scanning.
 *  - **2014** spreads the same ground across separate chapter entries whose ids are **random**
 *    (`5LoAJLkfIYBAgWTW` and friends) — verified against the installed system content — so those
 *    have to resolve by entry *name* and then page name.
 *
 * Nothing here reproduces any rules text; it points at content the world already has, and returns
 * null when it does not, so callers hide their control rather than offering a dead button.

 * A topic with no meaningful page under an edition maps to null, and callers get nothing back.
 * `page` lists the names known to carry it — the Player's Handbook module and the system's free
 * rules word the same page differently — and `prefix` is the step-number fallback (see
 * {@link pickPage}).
 *
 * Deliberately absent: **feats**. The 2014 rules have a real page for them (Chapter 6), but the 2024
 * `phbCreatingAChar` entry has none — origin feats live in a separate Feats entry entirely — and a
 * topic that silently opens "Character Creation Details" when a player asked about feats is worse
 * than no control at all. Add it when it can be pointed at the right page in both editions.
