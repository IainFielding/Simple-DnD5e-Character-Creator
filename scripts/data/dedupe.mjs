 * alone the grids show every one of them twice or three times, with nothing on the cards to tell
 * the copies apart.
 *
 * This module holds only the *policy* — which copy wins — and deliberately knows nothing about
 * Foundry. The one fact it needs from the outside (is a package the game system, or a real
 * installed book?) arrives as an injected lookup, so the rule is unit-testable without a running
 * game. {@link module:data/source-index} supplies the real lookup over `game.packs`.

 * system's bundled SRD is the generic fallback by definition.
