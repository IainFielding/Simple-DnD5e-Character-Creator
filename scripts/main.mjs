 * This is the module's entry point — module.json points Foundry here via "esmodules".
 * The file wires the module into Foundry's startup lifecycle using Hooks. A Hook is
 * Foundry's event system: `Hooks.once(event, fn)` runs `fn` a single time when that
 * event fires, `Hooks.on(event, fn)` runs it every time. The lifecycle order we use is:
 *   init   -> register settings and templates (before the game data is loaded)
 *   ready  -> everything is loaded; safe to touch actors, install our level-up takeover
 * We also listen for directory events to inject our "launch" button and the sidebar's
 * right-click "Level Up" entry.
