/**
 * Saving and restoring an unfinished character build.
 *
 * Nothing the creator collects is written to the world until Create, which is what keeps a
 * cancelled build from littering the actor directory — but it also meant closing the window threw
 * the whole thing away. A draft closes that gap without giving up the in-memory model: what is
 * stored is the *player's answers* (uuids, numbers, typed text), never a document. Rebuilding a
 * {@link CreatorState} from those answers is exactly what the creator does on every render anyway.
 *
 * The draft lives on a flag on `game.user`, so it is the player's own and follows them between
 * sessions and machines. A user may always update their own flags, so this needs no permission the
 * creator's audience doesn't already have.
 *
 * For a junior dev: three things to know before you touch this file.
 *   1. {@link DRAFT_FIELDS} is an allowlist, not an exclusion list. A new field on CreatorState is
 *      *not* persisted until it is named here — which is the safe default, because most new fields
 *      turn out to be transient UI or a cache that is cheaper to rebuild than to store.
 *   2. The answers are stored as a JSON **string**, not as a nested object. `setFlag` deep-merges
 *      an object into whatever is already stored, so a key the player cleared (an advancement pick
 *      they undid, an item they took out of the cart) would survive the save meant to remove it.
 *      A string is replaced wholesale, so what is read back is exactly what was written.
 *   3. Saving is debounced ({@link scheduleDraftSave}), because every save is a server round-trip
 *      and the creator dispatches on every click.
