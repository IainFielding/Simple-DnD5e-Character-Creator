 *
 *   const api = game.modules.get("sogrom-dnd5e-character-creator")?.api;
 *
 * Deliberately *not* also published as a global. A global would be a second name for the same
 * object that we would then have to keep alive forever, and `game.modules.get(...)` is the
 * documented way to find a module's surface.
 *
 * Nothing here is new behaviour: every entry forwards to a function that already existed and is
 * already the path the module's own UI takes. That is the point — an integrator gets the same
 * gates (mode setting, permissions, the cancellable hooks) that a click gets, rather than
 * reaching past them into internals.
 *
 * The companion to this file is the {@link HOOKS} registry in config.mjs; between them they are
 * the whole supported surface, and docs/API.md documents both.
 *
 * For a junior dev: think of this as the module's front door for *other code*. When you add
 * something here you are promising not to break it in the next release — so add sparingly, and
 * put anything experimental under `internal` where that promise explicitly does not apply.

 *
 * This lives in the API file rather than in main.mjs because it *is* the public entry point:
 * the sidebar button, the API and any consumer all come through here, so they cannot drift into
 * applying different gates. (It was module-private in main.mjs before the API existed; moving it
